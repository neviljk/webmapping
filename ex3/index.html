                THE PROVINCES OF SRI LANKA
            </div>
            <p class="bold">Introduction</p>
            <p>In Sri Lanka, provinces are the first level administrative division. They were first established by the British rulers of Ceylon in 1833. <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Sri_Lanka">[1]</a></p>
            <p>They created a legislative council, making the island a politically and administrative single unit. Five provinces were created at first which was then expanded into nine, and these
            were subdivided into twenty one districts. These districts were administered by officials known as Government Agents or Assistant Government Agents. <a href=

            <p class="bold">Northern Province</p>
            <p>The Northern Province was created on 1st October 1833. It is the first level administrative division of the country. The majority of the Sri Lankan Civil War was played out and had its
            roots in this province. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Province,_Sri_Lanka">[3]</a>.</p>
            <p class="bold">Eastern Province</p>
            <p>The Eastern Province, created on 1st October 1833 is also a first level administrative division with Ampara,Batticaloa and Trincomalee (Capital) as it's districts. <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Province,_Sri_Lanka">[4]</a>.</p>
            <p class="bold">North Central Province</p>
            <p>North Central Province was created in 1873, but was admitted in 14 November 1987. It is sparsely populated, and has a weak economy as the land tends to be dry tropical woodlands.

            <p class="bold">North Western Province</p>
            <p>North Western Province was created in 1845. Its capital is Kurunegala. The province is known mainly for its numerous coconut plantations. <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Western_Province,_Sri_Lanka">[6]</a>.</p>
            <p class="bold">Western Province</p>
            <p>Western province is a first level administration division of the country which was created on 1st October 1833. This province is vulnerable to recurrent flooding as a result of an
            increase in average rainfall coupled with heavier rainfall events, with knock-on impacts to the infrastructure, utility supply and the urban economy of the Province. <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Province,_Sri_Lanka">[7]</a>.</p>
            <p class="bold">Sabaragamuwa</p>
            <p>Sabaragamuwa province was created in 1889 (admitted in 14 November 1987). It is named after its former indigenous inhabitants, namely the Sabara, an indic term for hunter-gatherer
            tribes, a term seldom used in ancient Sri Lanka. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabaragamuwa_Province">[8]</a>.</p>
            <p class="bold">Central Province</p>
            <p>Central province was created in 1833 (admitted in 14 November 1987). Kandy (Capital),Matale and Nuwara Eliya are the 3 districts of this province which is primarily located in the
            central mountainous terrain of Sri Lanka. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Province,_Sri_Lanka">[9]</a>.</p>
            <p class="bold">Uva</p>
            <p>Uva Province is Sri Lanka's second least populated province, created in 1896. Its major tourist attractions are Dunhinda falls, Diyaluma Falls, Rawana Falls, the Yala National Park
            (lying partly in the Southern and Eastern Provinces) and Gal Oya National Park. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uva_Province">[10]</a>.</p>
            <p class="bold">Southern Province</p>
            <p>The Southern Province of Sri Lanka is a small geographic area consisting of the districts of Galle, Matara and Hambantota with Galle as capital. Subsistence farming and fishing is the
            main source of income for the vast majority of the people of this region. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Province,_Sri_Lanka">[11]</a>.</p>
